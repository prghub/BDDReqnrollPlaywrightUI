# BDDPlaywrightC#Reqnroll

This project demonstrates the integration of **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** using **Playwright** and **C#** to perform automated UI testing of a web application (SauceDemo). The test is structured using the **Reqnroll** framework to manage test scenarios and steps.

## Project Overview

This project contains a set of automated tests written in **C#** using **Playwright** for browser automation and **Reqnroll** for organizing and executing test scenarios. The key features tested in this project include:

- **Login** functionality of the SauceDemo application.
- **Inventory list** visibility after a successful login.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Playwright**: A modern browser automation library that supports web scraping, UI testing, and end-to-end testing.
- **Reqnroll**: A framework for defining, organizing, and executing steps and scenarios.
- **FluentAssertions**: A library to improve the readability and maintainability of assertions in tests.

## Features

- **Login Test**: Tests the login functionality using valid credentials.
- **Inventory Test**: Verifies that the inventory list is displayed after a successful login.

## Prerequisites

1. **.NET 6.0 or higher**: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine.
2. **Playwright**: A Playwright library for C#.
3. **FluentAssertions**: For writing clean and readable assertions.
